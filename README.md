# Left 2 Dead
## Overview
The main idea here is to create a small and modified version of the “Left 4 Dead” game.

The player controls the main character called Joel in an indoors or outdoors
environment. He is usually accompanied by a young girl by the name of Ellie or other
companions that the player chooses before gameplay. The goal of the player is to go through all
the levels while killing as many infected as possible in order to survive along with his
companion.

This repo contains the work done in unity and C# to create the game.
